# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

books = Book.create([{title: 'Cat in the Hat', author: 'Dr. Seuss', description: 'This is a kids book', url: 'www.bing.com' },])
